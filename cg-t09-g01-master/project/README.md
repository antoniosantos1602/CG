## Observations

Overall we were able to do most tasks asked for this project and we even took some creative liberties, our proudest include:
- a complex and pleasant fully textured bird model
- natural looking bird animations (the wings flap in a wavy pattern and the tail shakes a little with the wind)
- 6 eggs randomly positioned in the scene (each with its own texture)
- AI upscaled texture used for the terrain

Unfortunately we didn't have time to implement none of the three extra developments, but we still believe the final result came out good!

## Control Notes
- the keys W, A, S, D, R, P and O do the operations they were asked to
- while the bird is descending or ascending, pressing R doesn't do anything
- after successfully picking up an egg, the bird can't descend anymore with P until the egg is put in the nest
- the higher the bird speed, the hardest it is for it to accelerate even more, this is done in order to facilitate user control, because otherwise the bird could easily escape the terrain area
